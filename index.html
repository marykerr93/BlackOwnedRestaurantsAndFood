            - "My story begins in the South/West side of Detroit, MI watching my Mother Mary Lou feed her seven children and a countless amounts of others throughout the community, with her amazing soul food dishes like Greens, Mac-N-Cheese, Fried Chicken and her AWESOME BBQ. I furthered my love for food, namely Soul and BBQ, during my college days in Kansas City, MO where my love and my inspiration met at the World Famous Gates BBQ, and at that moment I knew that this is what I was destined to do. After tons of trial and error I finally holmed my craft into what I call JUST REAL GOOD FOOD!!! And  I hope you think so too!!!"
